# Codegraph: First Look

Get a structural overview of a codebase — no file reading needed. Uses the
**engram** MCP (which supersedes the old `codegraph` MCP).

## When to use

- "Understand this codebase"
- "What does this repo do?"
- "Give me an overview of this project"
- First encounter with a new repository

## Workflow

1. **Index the repo.** Call `scan_repo` with the absolute path.
   ```
   scan_repo({ "path": "/absolute/path/to/repo" })
   ```

2. **Get the architecture map.** Call `architecture` — one call replaces the old
   `repository_stats` + `central_symbols` + `bridge_symbols` + `call_communities`.
   ```
   architecture({ "limit": 20 })
   ```

3. **Get a context packet (optional).** For a high-level narrative:
   ```
   get_context({ "focus": "main" })
   ```

## How to synthesize

Present a concise narrative:

> This codebase has **N symbols** across **M modules**. The core abstractions are
> **X, Y, Z** (top PageRank). Be careful with **B** — it's a bridge symbol.

Do NOT read individual files unless asked. The graph tells you the structure.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scan_repo` | Index the repo. |
| `architecture` | Central + bridges + communities + stats. |
| `get_context` | Fused context packet. |
| `symbol_context` | Deep-dive a symbol (follow-up). |
