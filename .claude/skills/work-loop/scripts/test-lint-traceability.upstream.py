"""Self-test for the sibling lint-traceability.py (the structural-orphan lint).

Builds fixture workspaces in a tempdir and runs the linter as a subprocess
against the documented `python <skill>/scripts/lint-traceability.py --root <dir>`
invocation — the same shape the CI gate uses (a real subprocess, not a
synthesised import, so the real file-path entry point is exercised). Covers each
acceptance case: no-op clean, the sidecar-authoritative path (converged / orphan
/ dangling / cycle / bad-schema), the derive-from-artifacts standalone path
(clean / backward orphan / forward orphan / terminal exemption / layer-skip),
the three cross-repo endpoint states (local / satisfied-by-reference pinned and
unpinned / unresolvable), dangling-local and cycle hard violations, container
extraction, the exit-code matrix, and the structural-only / stdlib-only /
no-hardcoded-path NFRs.
