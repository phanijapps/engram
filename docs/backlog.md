# Backlog — open items by spec

Single index of **open** work across every spec in `docs/specs/`. Each item
names the spec, the Acceptance Criterion (where one applies), what's blocking
it, and how it gets unblocked. Closed/shipped work is **not** kept here — see
each spec's Changelog and [`product/changelog.md`](product/changelog.md).

This is the tactical **backlog**: per-instance, no pack-side source after first
install — it's yours to curate. It is distinct from the **product roadmap**
(strategy, not a work index) at [`product/roadmap.md`](product/roadmap.md).
"Roadmap" = direction; "backlog" = the work/deferral index.

Deferred acceptance criteria point here by **anchor**: a spec criterion written
`- [ ] <outcome> (deferred: <anchor>)` means `<anchor>` resolves to a heading in
this file (GitHub heading-slug rules — lowercase, spaces become hyphens). The
deferral lives here, version-controlled and greppable, not in a PR comment that
rots. See `CONVENTIONS.md` § 4 (Spec metadata contract).

## How this file is maintained

- Every spec records its own `Status:` field and `Acceptance Criteria`
  checkboxes. This file aggregates the **open** items so they're visible in one
  place — it is not the source of truth.
- When an AC closes or a spec ships, update the spec first, then **remove** the
  now-closed item here in the same change (closed work lives in the spec
  Changelog / `product/changelog.md`, not here).
- When a new spec lands with open ACs, add a section here.
- If an item here is no longer accurate against the underlying spec, trust the
  spec and fix this file.

## backend-agnostic-retrieval

- **Durable dedup (deferred: durable-dedup):** `content_hash`-keyed `ON CONFLICT`
  upsert so re-indexing a repo reuses unchanged embeddings, plus a dead-vector GC
  sweep — blocked on nothing; unblocked by a `sqlite-vec` adapter slice. [spec O2]
- **Rust composition orchestrator (deferred: rust-orchestrator):** a composition
  orchestrator in `core/orchestration` (the demo currently orchestrates in TS) —
  blocked on a second backend making TS-side orchestration insufficient;
  unblocked by the Postgres or Neo4j adapter. [spec T3; option b′]

## demo-reimagine-manual-qa

- **Manual QA (deferred: demo-reimagine-manual-qa):** two human-in-the-loop
  checks the automated gates can't cover — (1) render `/graph` against an indexed
  repo and confirm it reads at the class level (module/class hubs labeled, methods
  small until hover, colored clusters); (2) add the built stdio server to GitHub
  Copilot via the documented `bin` command and confirm `tools/list` + a
  `tools/call` succeed end-to-end. Blocked on nothing; needs a browser + a Copilot
  client. Mechanical proxies already green: graph-model unit tests, MCP in-memory
  protocol tests, and a stdout-clean `initialize` smoke. [spec manual-QA ACs]

## deployment-adapters (intent only — no spec yet)

- **pgvector(graph+vector) adapter:** one Postgres holding graph + chunks +
  embeddings. Documented target in RFC-0005 §Target deployments; needs an ADR +
  spec before work.
- **pgvector(vector) + neo4j(graph) adapter:** split deployment. Same — needs an
  ADR + spec before work.

## knowledge-source-retraction (intent only — no spec yet)

- **Document/chunk/embedding retraction on re-ingest:** `knowledge-graph-retraction`
  converges the knowledge *graph* (entities/relationships/graphs + Repository node),
  but not the underlying `SourceDocument`s, `KnowledgeChunk`s, or their sqlite-vec
  embeddings (keyed by `document_id`/`source_id`, not `graph_id`). A changed/removed
  file's prior document + chunks + vectors currently linger. Needs `delete_document`/
  `delete_chunk` ports, a vec-index delete-by-target-id, and a stable-key handle on
  documents so the reconcile can find prior documents by `(stable_source_key, path)`.
  RFC-0009 flagged the embedding cascade (OQ2). Needs a spec before work.

<!-- Add one section per spec with open work, e.g.:

## <spec-name>

- **AC<N> (deferred: <anchor>):** <what's open> — blocked on <X>; unblocked by <Y>.
